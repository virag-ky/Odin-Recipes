      <p>
        Here at Odin Project we need to keep our mind focused everyday to
        practice and learn. Sometimes we might forget to take time for
        ourselves. For selfcare, you might take time to go for a walk to refresh
        your mind, listen to music, play games or just take a nap. Well, in
        order to be successful in studying we need selfcare for sure, we need to
        treat our body good, so let's talk about <em>food</em>.
